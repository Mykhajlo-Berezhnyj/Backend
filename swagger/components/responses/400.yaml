  Bad Request — the server could not process the request due to a client error. 
  Possible reasons include:
    - "Empty contact data"
    - "Validation failed" — one or more fields are invalid or missing. 
    - "Malformed request" — the request format is incorrect.

  Not all of these errors apply to every endpoint. The actual reason depends on the specific request.
